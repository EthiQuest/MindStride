*   **Docker**: Containerization platform
*   **Docker Compose**: Tool for multi-container applications
*   **Flutter SDK** (if using Flutter) **OR**
*   **Node.js and npm** (if using React Native)
*   **Python 3.7+** and **pip**
*   **Virtual Environment Tool**: `venv` or `virtualenv`
*   **Garmin and Strava Developer Accounts**: For API access

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/MindStride.git
    cd MindStride
    ```
    
2.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    
    Create a `.env` file in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories and add your API keys and secrets.
    
3.  **Backend Setup**
    
    ```bash
    cd backend
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
4.  **Frontend Setup**
    
    *   **If using Flutter**:
        
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend
        flutter pub get
        ```
        
    *   **If using React Native**:
        
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend
        npm install
        ```
        
5.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose**
    
    Ensure you're in the root directory of the project:
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    
6.  **Access the Application**
    
    *   **Backend API**: `http://localhost:5000`
    *   **Frontend App**: Use an emulator or physical device connected to your development machine.
